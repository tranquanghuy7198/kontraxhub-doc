# Prepare NEAR Project

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable)
- Git
- Cargo
- Node.js (v18+)

## Install NEAR CLI

Using npm:

```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn global add near-cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
near --version
```

## Configure NEAR Client

Login to NEAR (creates/imports wallet):

```bash
near login
```

This will open a browser to authorize your account.

Switch to testnet (for development):

```bash
export NEAR_ENV=testnet
```

Or add to your shell profile for persistence:

```bash
echo 'export NEAR_ENV=testnet' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Get Testnet NEAR Tokens

Create a testnet account at [NEAR Testnet Wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/)

The wallet automatically receives testnet NEAR tokens.

Check your balance:

```bash
near state <your-account.testnet>
```

Or request additional tokens via [NEAR Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/).

## Create a New NEAR Rust Project

Initialize a new project:

```bash
cargo new --lib my_project
cd my_project
```

## Project Structure

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs            # Main contract code
├── Cargo.toml            # Package manifest
├── Cargo.lock
